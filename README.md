Gamerz Index

An app with a database of over 16000 popular games.

After creating an account you can search for games you own and add them to your collection.

Once you’ve added to your list of games you can then search for games you are interested in and offer to trade them with other users.

Why get 25 cents for a game that you paid 60 dollars for 2 months ago trade for the games you really want!
